README.md 
- the command to check the python version should be python3 --version 
- I think you should also provide instructions on how to run the unit tests at the very bottom 
- how come you have DOCS.md and README.md? Arent they the same thing
- Change #Run the python file# to #Run the game#


user_guess_unittest.py
- rename this to main_test.py
- Does importing unittest require you to package any dependencies?
- Looks good but I would add alot more tests, basically ~2 tests for every method in your main file.
- Would be a little more specific in the test names

main.py
- rename handle_game() to run_game(FKJ
- use len(image) rather than hardcoding 6 for the # of guesses
- rename image to images, since its an array
- change valid_input to correct_input. An input can be valid but not correct
- How come that call to handle_failure is commented out on line 65


General Comments:
- I would move all the static files(messages.txt, nouns.txt, etc) into a seperate folder and keep only the core files in the project root
